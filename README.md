# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to conduct various analyses on a large set of crowdfunding data that provided important fundraising campaign information. Data was sorted, organized, and analyzed using various filters including dates, categories, outcomes, and more to assess any relevant factors that may help predict future outcomes of theater campaigns which would be pertinent to Louise. Graphs were generated to display outcomes relative to goals and launch dates. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot chart was generated to display theater outcomes based on launch date.The general trend of the successful campaigns can be seen to have three peaks over the course of a year. Theater campaigns launched in the month of May exhibited the most successful outcomes and followed a gradual decline after that with two upwards spikes in the months of February and October. The numbver of failed campaigns did not seem to oscillate to far from 40 throughout the year but becomes slightly more erratic from from September to December. The number of canceled theater campaigns appears to remain the same year round. This graph suggests that one is more likely to have a successful theater campaign if it is launched in May. However this data alone is not conclusive as other factors should also be considered.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A line chart was generated to display all play outcomes based on goals. No play campaigns were canceled. 76% of play campaigns with goals less than 1,000$ were successful. The percentage of successful plays gradually decreases as the monetary goal increases but exhibits a spike once it reaches 30000$ only to sharply decline at monetary goals greater than 45000$.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The actual process of analysis was not entirely too difficult, however I found it most challenging to keep track of the various columns when inputting excel functions regarding the "outcomes based on goals" dataset. They were rather long functions and one must be very attentive to make sure the commas and apostrophes are typed in in the correct spot. I found the COUNTIFS function to be particularly tedious however after inputting the function over ten times, got the hang of it. I found the link provided by this module to very helpful [COUNTIFS link] (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). 
## Results
It would appear that May is the optimal month to launch a theater fundraising campaign as most theater campaigns launched in that month have successful outcomes. December seems to be the least optimal month to launch a theater fundraising campaign as very few are successful .
Play campaigns exhibit the highest outcome success rate when the goal is less than 1000$. Play campaigns with goals between 45000$ and 49999% exhibit a 0 success rate and it would appear as the least optimal range to establish one's monetary goal for their play campaign. 
While this dataset generates various trends, there is additional information we could collect that would help Louise better understand how pertinent they are for her particular campaign. It would be helpful to filter her outcomes and goals graphs to show only data from the country she is in. We could add this into our "Outcomes Based on Goals" sheet by adding "Kickstarter!G:G, "US" " to the excel functions when calculating the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes. Assuming she is in the US, it would also be helpful to further filter location to city. Various cities funnel a lot of money towards the arts/theater like New York City and Chicago versus other smaller cities or towns that perhaps dont have as large a patronage. Thus she could see a general success rate of theater campaigns in her own area to better gauge her chances. It would also be helpful to see the relationship between length of campaign and outcomes. For instance if longer campaigns have higher success rates than shorter campaigns, Louise might consider making her campaign last longer or vice versa.
