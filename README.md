# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to conduct various analyses on a large set of crowdfunding data that provided important fundraising campaign information. Data was sorted, organized, and analyzed using various filters including dates, categories, outcomes, and more to assess any relevant factors that may help predict future outcomes of theater campaigns which would be pertinent to Louise. In particular, graphs were generated to display outcomes relative to goals and launch dates. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot chart was generated to display theater outcomes based on launch date. The graph can be seen below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
The actual process of analysis was not entirely too difficult, however I found it most challenging to keep track of the various columns when inputting excel functions regarding the "outcomes based on goals" dataset. They were rather long functions and one must be very attentive to make sure the commas and apostrophes are typed in in the correct spot. I found the COUNTIFS function to be particularly tedious however after inputting the function over ten times, got the hang of it. I found the link provided by this module to very helpful [COUNTIFS link] (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).
